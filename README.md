# Overview

This is a cryptocurrency tracking application that allows users to:
- View real-time price data for top cryptocurrencies using the CoinGecko API
- See historical price charts and market data
- Interact with an AI assistant powered by Google's Gemini API to analyze crypto trends and get insights

This project was built with mobile-first designs in mind but also demonstrates integration of external APIs (Gemini & CoinGecko), real-time data visualization (Recharts), and AI-powered analysis in a React TypeScript application. It uses modern React patterns and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Future TODOs
- Comparison between 2 cryptocurrencies and graphs it via Recharts
- Scraping trending headlines and news from Twitter, Reddit, etc.
